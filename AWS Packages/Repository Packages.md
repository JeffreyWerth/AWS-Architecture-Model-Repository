# Repository Packages Definitions

This section covers the scope for all the GitHub structure packages used to host all the views and model elements that makes the AWS Architecture Model Repository open source project.

## Use Cases

Specifying system use cases is a common design activity for systems engineering teams. The AWS Use Cases Package diagram Package supports the AWS Model Repository by helping manage various kinds of elements and relationships (Stakeholder needs) to express information about the AWS services and defines the stakeholders who require those services.

The package will help manage the repository base on the AWS Marketplace use cases suggested through the AWS solution area site (https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/solutions/awsmp-all-use-cases).
