# Systems Modeling Language (SysML)

The Object Management Group Systems Modeling Language (OMG SysML), simply stated as SysML, is a general-purpose modeling language for systems engineering applications.

SysML supports the specification, analysis, design, verification, and validation of a broad range of systems. SysML consists of Abstract Syntax and Concrete Syntax:
- Abstract Syntax is the set of rules that identify what you can and cannot do
- Concrete Syntax is the set of notations that you are allowed to use on diagrams

## What are SysML Diagrams?

- Diagrams are elements in your model
- Diagrams are views of the model
- The model itself is generally shown as elements within a hierarchical structure of nested packages (often referenced as the CSM term: Containment Tree)
- A diagram is a partial graphical representation of the model that is generated to satisfy a stakeholderâ€™s request
- A diagram can also be a partial graphical representation of the model element that the diagram represents
- An item can exist in your model without being shown on any diagrams
- A set of diagrams does not need to completely cover the model
- Deleting an item from a diagram does not remove it from the model
- Deleting a diagram does not affect the elements, or the relationships between elements, that were displayed on that diagram
