,Security Group,"A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic. Inbound rules control the incoming traffic to your instance, and outbound rules control the outgoing traffic from your instance. When you launch an instance, you can specify one or more security groups.",AWS: Security Group,Port -<<full>> sc : Virtual Firewall,Operations : Inbound Rules
EC2 IP,Elastic Compute 2 Internet Protocol,"Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC support both the IPv4 and IPv6 addressing protocols. By default, Amazon VPC uses the IPv4 addressing protocol; you can't disable this behavior. When you create a VPC, you must specify an IPv4 CIDR block (a range of private IPv4 addresses). You can optionally assign an IPv6 CIDR block to your VPC and assign IPv6 addresses from that block to instances in your subnets.",AWS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html,,
,Elastic IP,"An Elastic IP address is a static public IPv4 address associated with your AWS account in a specific Region. Unlike an auto-assigned public IP address, an Elastic IP address is preserved after you stop and start your instance in a virtual private cloud (VPC).","AWS: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-associate-static-public-ip/#:~:text=An%20Elastic%20IP%20address%20is,virtual%20private%20cloud%20(VPC).",,
AMI,Amazon Machine Image,An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a supported and maintained image provided by AWS that provides the information required to launch an instance. You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance. You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you require multiple instances with the same configuration,AWS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/AMIs.html,,
,Key Pairs,"To enable your end users to launch the product that is based on the sample template for this tutorial, you must create an Amazon EC2 key pair. A key pair is a combination of a public key that is used to encrypt data and a private key that is used to decrypt data. For more information about key pairs, see Amazon EC2 Key Pairs in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances",AWS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/getstarted-keypair.html,,

,Listener - Load Balancer,"A listener is a process that checks for connection requests. It is configured with a protocol and a port for front-end (client to load balancer) connections, and a protocol and a port for back-end (load balancer to back-end instance) connections.",AWS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-listener-config.html,,
,Target Group - Load Balancer,"A target group tells a load balancer where to direct traffic to : EC2 instances, fixed IP addresses; or AWS Lambda functions, amongst others. When creating a load balancer, you create one or more listeners and configure listener rules to direct the traffic to one target group.","AWS: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-application-load-balancer-simplifies-deployment-with-weighted-target-groups/#:~:text=A%20target%20group%20tells%20a,traffic%20to%20one%20target%20group.",,
,Rule - Load Balancer,Rules give your devices the ability to interact with AWS services. Rules are analyzed and actions are performed based on the MQTT topic stream.,AWS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-rules.html,,
,Auto Scaling - Target Group,"AWS Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. Using AWS Auto Scaling, it’s easy to setup application scaling for multiple resources across multiple services in minutes","AWS: https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/#:~:text=AWS%20Auto%20Scaling%20monitors%20your,across%20multiple%20services%20in%20minutes.",,
CW Alarm,Cloud Watch Alarm - Auto Scaling,A metric alarm watches a single CloudWatch metric or the result of a math expression based on CloudWatch metrics.

VPC,Virtual Private Cloud,"Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.",AWS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html,,
,Identity Federation,"Identity federation is a system of trust between two parties for the purpose of authenticating users and conveying information needed to authorize their access to resources. In this system, an identity provider (IdP) is responsible for user authentication, and a service provider (SP), such as a service or an application, controls access to resources. ","AWS : https://aws.amazon.com/identity/federation/#:~:text=Identity%20federation%20in%20AWS,authorize%20their%20access%20to%20resources.",,
,Amazon Cognito,"With Amazon Cognito, you can add user sign-up and sign-in features and control access to your web and mobile applications.

Built on open identity standards, Amazon Cognito supports various compliance regulations and integrates with frontend and backend development resources.",AWS: https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/,,
,User Pools,"A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. With a user pool, your users can sign in to your web or mobile app through Amazon Cognito. Your users can also sign in through social identity providers like Google, Facebook, Amazon, or Apple, and through SAML identity providers. Whether your users sign in directly or through a third party, all members of the user pool have a directory profile that you can access through a Software Development Kit (SDK).",AWS : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html,,
,Identity Pools,Amazon Cognito identity pools provide temporary AWS credentials for users who are guests (unauthenticated) and for users who have been authenticated and received a token. An identity pool is a store of user identity data specific to your account.,AWS : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/identity-pools.html,,
