# AWS-SysML-Architecture-Model-Repository

The AWS SysML Architecture Model Repository, is an open source project on GitHub for any Systems Engineeering students to collaborate and learn how to model cloud systems using SysML.

## Objectives

At the end of this independent project, the student should have an awareness of:

- Motivation of model-based systems engineering approach
- SysML diagrams and basic language concepts
- How SysML us used as part of an MBSE process by the application of Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM).

## Scope

AWS as a cloud platform has more than one hundred cloud services, which enable organizations to secure, store and compute their data on the cloud. This benefits the organization in a way that there is no need for physical hardware to manage the IT infrastructure of the organization. The intent of this open source project on GitHub, is to model these services using SysML to better understand how these services impact the enterprise, and help organizations transferring their data from physical applications to cloud-based infrastructure, applications, and legacy systems; with the goal to understand any security impacts on how the data is manage and transfer using SysML to model the interfaces that makes these IT systems live in the Cloud. Attached is an AWS SysML Architecture Model Dictionary and Glossary for the library of systems, services and model elements that will make this open-source project in GitHub for the Systems Engineering community that wants to learn how to model Cloud Systems by Systems Modeling Language (SysML).

## Expected Results and Using Github
