# Use Cases

Use Cases provide means for describing basic functionality in terms of usages/goals of the system by actors.

*Lesson 3 reading: SysML Distilled - A Brief Guide to the Systems Modeling Language 1st Edition Chapter 5 Use Case Diagrams*

## Use Case Basics

Use Cases are externally visible services a system provides, depicted in an ellipse, as a verb or phrase. The Use Case specification conveys the narrative that unfolds when a primary actor invokes the use case.

What does a use case diagram conveys?
- A set of use cases and actors that invoke and participate in them
- Invoke (primary); participate (secondary)

Use Cases is a classifier, an element of definition, please reference Lesson 4_Elements of Definition vs Usage to better understand this concept.

## Use Case Diagram Components

Use Case Diagrams are comprised of the following:
- Subject
- Actors
- Use cases
- Relationships

See Example Figure 5 bellow.

### Subject

Subject provides functionality in support of the use cases, represents a system being developed, also called the 'system under consideration'. The subject is represented by a rectangle on the use case diagram, see Figure 6.

### Actors

Actors used to represent something that uses the system, but not 'part' of the System, simply actors interface with the system. 

Actors can be a person or another system, usually depicted by a stick figure and/or block with **<<actor>>** label, see Figure 7. Name the Actors base on the **role** they perform as a user of the system (e.g. customer, administrator, developer etc)

### Use Cases or Actions

Actions are represent the goals that a system will support, depicted by an oval with the Use Case name inside. Name should consist of a verb and a noun that descirbe the functionality of the system (e.g. deploy static website)


### Relationships
