# AWS-SysML-Architecture-Model-Repository

The AWS SysML Architecture Model Repository, is an open source project on GitHub for any Systems Engineeering professionals or students to collaborate and learn how to model cloud systems using SysML.

## Objectives

At the end of this independent project, the student should have an awareness of:

- model-based systems engineering approach
- SysML language and modeling abstract systems
- How SysML is used as part of an MBSE proces.

## Scope

AWS as a cloud platform has more than one hundred cloud services, which enable organizations to secure, store and compute their data on the cloud. This benefits the organization in a way that there is no need for physical hardware to manage the IT infrastructure of the organization.

The intent of this open source project on GitHub, is to model these services using SysML to better understand how these services impact the enterprise, and help organizations transferring their data from physical applications to cloud-based infrastructure, applications, and legacy systems; with the goal to understand any security impacts on how the data is manage and transfer using SysML to model the interfaces that makes these IT systems live in the Cloud.

Attached in this repository, is an AWS SysML Architecture Model Dictionary and Glossary to catalog the model elements that will make a library of systems and services that makes the AWS ecosystem. The library of model view will remain as a project in GitHub, for the Systems Engineering community, to learn how to model Cloud Systems by Systems Modeling Language (SysML).

## Expected Results and Using Github

The independent project submission for any of the model elements chosen by the Systems Engineer, shall follow the requirements of OMG Systems Modeling Language version 1.6. The model views shall follow the following GitHub S3 Example under SysML Modeling Notes and Examples, with the intent to follow the OMG Standards when presenting the views of the system under consideration. When starting a new project recomend forking this repository and restructuring to follow the file structure and then deleting everything in the README section up to the SysML Modeling Notes and Examples to submit your project.

The submission shall have the following sections:

- Model Description and Dictionary
- Structure Diagrams
- Behavioral Diagrams
- Requirements Diagrams
